# StealthBridge SDK

**Engineering roadmap:** [View the repository-specific plan](ROADMAP.md).

An initial **read-only TypeScript SDK** for live StealthBridge network and corridor metadata.

```ts
import { StealthBridgeClient } from "@stealthbridge/sdk";
const client = new StealthBridgeClient({ apiBaseUrl: "https://your-api.example", network: "testnet" });
const chain = await client.network();    // real observed Stellar ledger from backend
const corridors = await client.corridors(); // real PostgreSQL records or explicit 503
```

The public functions return network metadata, capability flags and actual configured corridors. A data-unavailable response is an error, **never replaced with demo values**. The API rejects non-HTTPS remote URLs.

## Security and status

No payment submission, signing, wallet custody, encrypted note management, ZK proof generation, mainnet, or fiat integration. This SDK is not a confidential transfer implementation.

See [compatibility matrix](specs/COMPATIBILITY.md), the [backend API](https://github.com/stealthbridge-labs/stealthbridge-backend/blob/main/api/openapi.yaml), [frontend](https://github.com/stealthbridge-labs/stealthbridge-frontend), and [contracts](https://github.com/stealthbridge-labs/stealthbridge-contracts).

## Runtime and package compatibility

The only public package entry point is `@stealthbridge/sdk`. It is native ESM and exports the runtime values `StealthBridgeClient` and `ApiError`, plus the TypeScript types `ClientConfig`, `Network`, `PrivacyRail`, `SettlementState`, `Capabilities`, `NetworkStatus`, `Corridor`, `SettlementSummary`, and `TransactionObservation`. Internal `dist/*` paths are not public exports.

- Node.js: 22 or newer, ESM only. CommonJS `require()` is not supported.
- Browsers: ES2022 with built-in `fetch`, `Response`, and `URL`, using a bundler that understands package `exports`. CI verifies this with esbuild and a pinned Next.js 16.4 App Router production build.
- TypeScript: declarations are generated beside the ESM output and resolved through the `types` export condition.
- Network: Stellar Testnet only. Browser calls are still subject to the backend's CORS policy.

The package remains private and unpublished while licensing and release approval are pending. To inspect the exact local package consumers without publishing:

```sh
npm ci
npm run verify
```

`npm run verify` type-checks and builds the source, creates `artifacts/stealthbridge-sdk-0.2.0.tgz`, validates SHA-256 plus npm's SHA-1/SHA-512 integrity metadata and contents, then installs that tarball into isolated Node.js, TypeScript, esbuild, and Next.js fixtures. The Next.js fixture proves the installed `dist/index.js` entry resolves in both a Server Component and a `"use client"` Client Component. It does not need a backend, wallet, credentials, or deployment. The fixture's pinned dependencies require registry access on a cold cache.

The current package-test baseline is approximately 18.1 KB packed / 61.7 KB unpacked, with a 10.47 KB full minified browser ESM bundle, a 286 B `ApiError`-only bundle and 11.3 KB across SDK-bearing Next.js client chunks. Package-test ceilings are 28 KB packed, 68 KB unpacked, 10.5 KB full browser, 1.6 KB tree-shaken, and 25 KB for SDK-bearing Next.js client chunks. A size change that exceeds a ceiling requires review and an explicit budget update with fresh measurements.

## Consumer errors

- The constructor throws `Error` for a network other than `"testnet"`, a non-HTTP(S) URL, or non-local plaintext HTTP.
- `transaction(hash)` throws `TypeError` before any request unless the hash is exactly 64 hexadecimal characters.
- A completed non-2xx response throws `ApiError`; inspect its numeric `status`, requested `path`, stable `code` and optional `traceId`. Its message never copies raw upstream error details. A transaction 404 can also mean the RPC node no longer retains that transaction.
- Native URL, fetch, CORS, DNS, and connection failures pass through unchanged. The client does not retry or replace unavailable data with examples.

## On-chain observation, without leaking contract events

```ts
const observed = await client.transaction(realTransactionHash); // exact 64-hex hash
console.log(observed.status, observed.ledger);
```

The result verifies **chain inclusion only**. It does not prove private-payment anonymity, bank payout or token redemption; older hashes may be unavailable from RPC retention. The SDK has offline tests for URL restrictions, malformed hashes, missing transactions and safe read-only behavior. See [the engineering roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## Exact-value asset operations

```ts
import { AssetAmount } from "@stealthbridge/sdk";
const verifiedAsset = {
  network: "testnet", kind: "soroban-token",
  identifier: assetIdFromYourVerifiedConfiguration,
  decimals: decimalsFromYourVerifiedContract
} as const;
const amount = AssetAmount.parse(verifiedAsset, valueEnteredAsDecimalString);
const total = amount.add(otherAmountOfSameAsset);
console.log(total.format(), total.minorUnits.toString());
```

This is a *pure amount utility*, not a conversion rate or transfer feature. It rejects floating-point inputs, ambiguous decimal strings, unsupported precision, negative values and cross-asset operations. Asset identity/decimals **must be verified from real chain/issuer metadata**; never assume precision or trusted issuer from this helper. Bigints serialize explicitly to minor-unit strings.

## Verified contract manifest parsing

Use `parseDeploymentManifest(input)` and `getVerifiedContract(manifest,name,{sourceRevision})` to prevent accidental use of unconfirmed or non-Testnet contract identifiers. The canonical contracts manifest is still schema v1 and explicitly `not-deployed`; it must **not** be represented as a functioning protocol. The parser accepts that empty manifest and a strict forward schema-v2 fixture requiring the Testnet passphrase, supported protocol/API versions, a pinned source revision, contract IDs, matching ABI/WASM digests and transaction evidence. `getVerifiedContract` can compare the manifest to a consumer-pinned source revision and versions. `contracts()` separately validates the canonical undeployed API response and exact public method inventory. These checks do **not** independently prove an on-chain deployment or attest to a token issuer. See `src/manifest.ts` and `specs/COMPATIBILITY.md`.

## Resilient read-only client

The SDK validates actual response schemas for network identity, corridors, capabilities, health and transaction observations before returning them. Responses that are malformed, oversized (> 64 KB), missing JSON Content-Type headers, or incompatible with Stellar Testnet fail closed with `ApiError(502,path)`; no synthetic results are returned.

Set `timeoutMs` between 100 and 60000 milliseconds (10 seconds by default) and pass `{signal:AbortSignal}` to any read. Requests use `AbortSignal.any()` for cancellation and timeout. Opt-in bounded retries (`maxRetries` up to 5, default 0) with exponential backoff (`retryBackoffMs`, default 100ms) can be configured globally or per-request for GET reads encountering 429, 502, 503, 504, or network timeouts. Client 400 and 404 errors are non-retryable. **No money-moving method is exposed, and no implicit retries exist for non-GET operations.**

### Single corridor detail

`client.corridor(corridorId)` retrieves the actual enabled corridor record by UUID. Invalid identifiers fail before fetching; unknown, disabled or unavailable corridors raise HTTP errors. A database record is **not** evidence of active provider support, licensed payouts or a verified contract deployment.

## Detailed developer guide

[Read the implementation and integration guide](docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md) for current API boundaries, usage, verification and security requirements.

## Bounded client responses and opt-in retries

Every GET has a total configurable timeout, optional AbortSignal, and a 64 KiB **streamed byte limit**. Oversized responses are rejected as upstream errors before the full body is accumulated, and malformed or unexpected response types are not transformed into fictional data. Retries are **off by default**; to explicitly retry only 429/502/503 GET failures, pass \`{retries: 1}\` or \`{retries: 2}\`. A single overall timeout/AbortSignal covers retries and exponential backoff. Client-side financial mutation methods do not exist and will never inherit this retry policy implicitly.

## Bounded corridor discovery

\`client.corridorsPage({limit:25})\` calls the backend's **read-only** keyset endpoint. Use \`page.next_cursor\` as \`after\` for the next request. Page sizes are restricted to 1–100 and both incoming cursors and returned records are validated. An empty page is a genuine empty database result, not an invented corridor. Concurrent operator changes may affect subsequent pages; pagination is not a transactionally frozen snapshot.

\`\`\`ts
const first = await client.corridorsPage({limit:25});
if(first.next_cursor){
  const second = await client.corridorsPage({after:first.next_cursor,limit:25});
}
\`\`\`

This method is separate from the backwards-compatible \`corridors()\` listing; it never creates quote, payment or partner relationships.

## Opt-in ledger observer support

The backend can persist a monotonic **public Testnet ledger head** after independently checking RPC network identity. With an operator-managed database and explicit observer activation, \`client.observerHead()\` reads that last stored checkpoint. An absent checkpoint returns HTTP 404, unavailable storage 503, and malformed schema a rejected protocol response. This **does not prove a payment occurred** and does not contain transaction XDR, a settlement receipt, account data or a fiat payout. The field may be stale if the observer is stopped.

## Pure settlement lifecycle interpretation

The SDK exports \`allowedSettlementTransitions\`, \`canTransitionSettlement(from,to)\`, \`assertSettlementTransition(from,to)\`, \`isSettlementState(value)\` and \`isTerminalSettlementState(state)\`. These mirror the backend's explicit **domain state machine**; they are for rendering and validating lifecycle information, not creating/approving/executing financial operations.

In particular, \`chain_finalized\` **cannot** advance directly to \`payout_completed\`; external payout confirmation and reconciliation are distinct. Terminal state is not synonymous with successful payment (e.g. \`expired\` and \`rejected\` are terminal). Versions must remain aligned across backend/SDK; CI tests fail on invalid transitions. No client-side transition is proof of actual chain or payout evidence.

## Service dependency readiness

\`client.readiness()\` reads the backend's \`GET /ready\` route, and validates the relationship between \`status\`, \`stellar_rpc\`, \`database\`, and an explicitly **disabled payments** capability. Database status distinguishes \`not-configured\` from a configured but \`unavailable\` dependency. A fully connected process can report \`ready\` for its observation dependencies while **payments remain disabled**. Absent/unavailable dependencies cause the backend's HTTP 503 and are not rewritten to success by the SDK.

## Bounded streaming corridor scans

The SDK now offers `scanCorridors({pageSize:25,maxPages:20,signal})`, an asynchronous iterator over **real** configured records. It limits the number of HTTP requests, supports caller cancellation and bounded GET retry settings, checks UUID cursor progress, ordering and duplicate records, and terminates when the backend returns a null cursor. The default cap is at most 20 requests, not an exhaustive scan guarantee; use `corridorsPage` with explicit cursors for larger catalogs. No data is fabricated, and no transfer or payout operation is performed.

## Canonical cross-repository contract discovery

`client.contracts()` retrieves `GET /v1/contracts` from the Rust backend. The backend embeds the **real**, currently `not-deployed` Testnet manifest from the Soroban contracts repository. An automated backend CI check compares its snapshot with the canonical contracts repo so source drift fails early. The SDK validates schema, network, record emptiness and explicit `on_chain_verified=false` / `payment_execution_enabled=false`. It rejects any premature deployed/verified claim; no contract ID or payment capability is conjured. After an independently verified Soroban deployment, this interface must be extended with actual chain attestation before enabling contract operations. The SDK does not sign or simulate fund movement.

### Source-level registry ABI inventory

`contracts().public_interface` contains the read method names, argument shapes and explicitly separated administrator writes for both current Soroban registry sources. The authoritative snapshot lives at `stealthbridge-contracts/integrations/public-soroban-interface.v1.json`; the backend compares its mirrored copy in CI and serves it to SDK clients. The SDK validates the read names against the pinned source interface and rejects unknown read capabilities. This is a method inventory only: without a real deployed Contract ID and independent chain attestation, no Soroban invocation can run. No wallet seed or private proof is accepted here.
